*Cart Products* needs to be used together with :t3ext:`cart`.

* EXT:cart itself is only the base for a webshop.
* EXT:cart_books provides products which can be created in the TYPO3 backend.

  * Those products fit many use cases for books, magazines and journals.
  * The books, magazines and journals can be displayed on the website with a list view and a detail view.
  * As said does it extend EXT:cart so those products can be purchased with the cart of EXT:cart.
